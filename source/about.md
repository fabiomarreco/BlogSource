I am Fabio Marreco, currently working at Accenture in Rio de Janeiro where we develop a Front-To-End financial application.

I´ve been programming since I was a kid, but I have also interests in mathematics, risk management and finance.

I´m always learning, this is what makes me happy! But sometimes I feel like sharing my thoughts, even if nobody is reading ;) 

But if you are reading, please comment and criticize. That is what makes us grow!
